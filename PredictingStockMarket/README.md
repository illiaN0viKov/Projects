Stock Market Prediction Model

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a stock market prediction system using historical S&P 500 data. It utilizes machine learning techniques, particularly the RandomForestClassifier from the sklearn library, to predict whether the market will go up or down based on technical indicators derived from historical price data.
